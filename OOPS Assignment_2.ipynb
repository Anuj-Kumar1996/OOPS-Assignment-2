    "# Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Abstraction in OOPs is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary features. This allows users to interact with objects without needing to understand the underlying complexity.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a car. When you drive, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift without needing to know how the engine or transmission works. The car's internal workings are abstracted away, allowing you to focus on driving."
